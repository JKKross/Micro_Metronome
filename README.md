<h2>THE APP IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED!!!</h2>

Due to my personal issues with Apple, I decided to abandon this project.
If anyone wants to "steal" the app, go for it.
If you do, I'd appreciate some slight design changes & maybe an "honorable mention", but it's definitely not mandatory ;-)

Micro Metronome is a minimalist metronome for iOS, iPadOS & MacOS.

There are no fancy features like setlists or time signatures.
Just a few nice sounds, multiple easy ways to set tempo and that's it.

The focus is on core functionality, reliability & small binary size. (I know 5 megs is not small, but most of that are the sound assets)
