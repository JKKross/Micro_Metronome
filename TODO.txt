Settings - make the whole row of sound tapable
Play sound when changed in settings & !isPlaying
REFACTOR!!! - separate audio from the "mainController" (now audioController); try functions for setting bpm etc. instead of willSet in @Published properties

"You've practiced x hours & x minutes" sync between devices ???
Handoff (bpm, sound, isPlaying) ???
Separate the audio handling into a framework ???
Playlists ???
Scroll (mouse/trackpad) to change bpm ???
Haptics when silenced ???
