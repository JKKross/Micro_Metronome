Implement Decoding & Encoding of aiff (Encoding means inserting or removing samples [zeroes] depending on the bpm)
Preprocess files??? (remove comment chunk etc.)
Implement real playback (continue with AVAudioPlayer or drop down to AVAudioEngine???)

AudioSession config:
- play when muted
- play in background
- when volume is 0%, vibrate
- duck others ???

Figure out what to do with magic number 100 in BPM.swift (the play button is 75 height + 25 padding)
Settings screen

Handle the bpm slider not changing to the correct y when rotating device
Siri Shortcuts support
